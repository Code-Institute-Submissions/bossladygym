      <h1>Our Goal? Women are Greater Fitter</h1>
      <p>Extensive research proves that women and mens health and bodies differ, hence, should be treated differently.</p>

      <p>We are a WOMEN-ONLY gym located in women wonderland. Catering to all women of every race, size and fit, we have been providing exceptional services and women designed equipment for twenty-five years now. If you are looking to change your look, boost your confidence and work with like-minded women with similar goals, Boss Lady Gym is for you.</p>

    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Our history began nine years ago- in 2011 when our founder, Mary Louise got tired of the constatnt harassment she faced at her London community gym. On top of that, she was concerned about her figure and longed for the naked yoga classes she took while on holiday in the Himalayan Islands. This lack of space for like-minded women at her gym pushed her to start what we now know as Boss Lady gym.</p>
    <p>So far, we have had notable women mentors such as Kelly Rowland, Kate Hudson and Ernestine Shepherd pioneer workout routines, select equipment and administer classes for boss ladies. You just might be lucky to have Kelly rowland at your next yoga class!</p>
