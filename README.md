Boss Lady Gym

There is an abundance of research that shows that 34% of women work out compared to 28% of men (), there is a lack of published studies in women health and fitness data that inform policies surrounding fitness, diets and medical advice and how much testosterone affects women’s productivity in gyms. Yet, there is a scarcity of spaces and equipment specifically engineered for the ever changing phases of women lives.

Boss Lady gym is the first ever women only gym in women wonderland with classes and equipments specifically designed for the female body. This gym is also a world pioneer of female fitness mentors for every boss lady at our gym.

UX

This website is for fitness enthusiast women aged 13 and above and is looking to achieve privacy and fitness with like-minded women. This website is the best way to help them achieve this as it specifies various membership types as well as where to reach.


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

* As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
* As a user, I want to see the navigation links legibly so that I can navigate around the website successfully and easily.
* As a user, I want to see the same information across my laptop/desktop, iPhone and tablet.
* As a user, I want to see what the gym is about on the first page(home page), so I can proceed to viewing other pages.
* As a user, I want to see what the gym is about on the about us page without feeling overwhelmed with text, so that I can proceed with viewing other pages.
* As a user, I want to see the various kinds of membership available on the membership page, their prices and a summary of what they are about so I can make an informed choice.
* As a user, I want to be put in my details on the contact us form and  be sure that the gum receives my enquiry/email.
* As a user, I want to click on the social media links (twitter, facebook and instagram) and be redirected to the various web pages of twitter, facebook and instagram.
* As a user, I want to visibly see the gym’s address in a legible manner so I can pay a visit to the gym if I want.
* As a user, I want to click on the download free pass button and get downloadable pass on a different tab.
* As a user, I should be able to scroll with ease on every web page without struggling to see information hidden by the sides.


ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

1. Clicking on any of the navigation links should take the user to the required webpage.
2. Website information should be consistent across various devices.
3. Text and pictures should not overwhelm users on any page especially on the about us page.
4. Form should be validated and return fake addresses.
5. Floats are properly implemented to avoid loss of information and uniformity.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
* Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
* ...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
* Assistive technology for blind, deaf and visually impaired people.
* Downloadable free gym pass

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

* HTML & CSS
    * The project uses HTML  for the structure of the website and CSS for styling.
* Bootstrap
    * The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.


Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1. Contact form:
    * Go to the "Contact Us" page
    * Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    * Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    * Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
